    "* TensorFlow works by first defining and describing our model in abstract, and then, when we are ready, we make it a reality in the session. The description of the model is what is known as your \"Computation Graph\" in TensorFlow terms.\n",
    "* TensorFlow allows us to perform specific machine learning number-crunching operations like derivatives on huge matricies with large efficiency. We can also easily distribute this processing across our CPU cores, GPU cores, or even multiple devices like multiple GPUs. \n",
    "* TensorFlow at its core is a Matrix/Array manipulation library.\n",
    "* A tensor is an array-like object, and, as you've seen, an array can hold your matrix, your vector, and really even a scalar.<br>"
