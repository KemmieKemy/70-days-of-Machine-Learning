# 70 days of Machine Learning
_This repository was made to track my progress during Data Science Nigeria's 70 days of Machine Learning_<br>
* Day 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning
* Day 7 - How Linear Regression works
* Day 10 - R-Squared theory;<br> 
Another name for R-squared error is Coefficient of Determination. <br>
Error is the distance between a point and a line of best fit. <br>
The error is squared to get a positive value of our error.
* Day 13 - Introduction to K Nearest Neighbors algorithm; <br>
'K' in the "K Nearest Neighbors" algorithm is a parameter that refers to the number of nearest neighbors to consider during voting process <br>
K Nearest Neighbors algorithm is classified as supervised learning <br>
Clustering is the process of dividing data points into a number of similar groups <br>
