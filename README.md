# 70 days of Machine Learning
_This repository was made to keep track of my progress during Data Science Nigeria's 70 days of Machine Learning_<br>
* Day 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning
* Day 7 - How Linear Regression works
* Day 10 - R-Squared theory;<br> 
Another name for R-squared error is Coefficient of Determination. <br>
Error is the distance between a point and a line of best fit. <br>
The error is squared to get a positive value of our error.
* Day 13 - Introduction to K Nearest Neighbors algorithm; <br>
'K' in the "K Nearest Neighbors" algorithm is a parameter that refers to the number of nearest neighbors to consider during voting process. <br>
K Nearest Neighbors algorithm is classified as supervised learning. <br>
Clustering is the process of dividing data points into a number of similar groups. <br>
* Day 21 - Understanding Vectors; <br>
The magnitude of a vector is denoted with Bars. <br>
Learnt how to calculate the magnitude of the vector. <br>
* Day 22 - Support Vector Assertion; <br>
Dot product is the relationship between the input and weight. <br>
If vector "u", dotted with vector "w + b" equals zero, it means that Vector u is on the decision boundary. <br>
If vector "u", dotted with vector "w + b" is greater or equal to zero, it means that the sample is of a class above the hyperplane. <br>
* Day 23 - Support Vector Machine Fundamentals; <br>
A support vector is a feature set that if moved, affects the position of the best separating hyperplane. <br>
* Day 24 - Support Vector Machine Optimization; <br>
Equation for hyperplane is X.W + b <br>
Support Vector Machines are less effective when the data is noisy and contains overlapping points. <br>
* Day 29 & 30 - Introduction to Kernels; <br>
Kernels are done using inner product. <br>
Kernels take two inputs and outputs the similarities. <br>
Inner Product is a projection of x1 onto x2. <br>
Kernel is represented using the greek letter "phi"<br>
Transformation of the old and creation of new hyperplane helps SVM to perform better on non-linearly separable data. <br>
The default kernel for SVM using sckit-learn is Radio base function <br>
* Day 31 - Soft Margin SVM
